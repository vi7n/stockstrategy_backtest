# stockstrategy_backtest
python programs to test and compare trade strategies

files A5 to A8 are same as stra1 to stra4. most test/changes will happen in these files and only stable versions will be added as a strategy
currently no clear indicator/strategy

TODOs
- need to verify all strategies perform as shown in the matplot output.
- is the ichimoku cloud correct? verify with webull or tradingview
- convert the strategies to pine editor code (?) and backtest on trading view
- figure out what pine editor webull uses. is it a version problem or entirely different thing?
- why is the volume data in alpaca different than stock brokers?
- is this the same for Polygon?
